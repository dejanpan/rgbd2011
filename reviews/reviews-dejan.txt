Title: FAB-MAP 3D: Topolocial Mapping with Spatial and Visual Appearance (R. Paul and P. Newman)
technical soundness: 5/5
demo: 0/5
clarity of description: 5/5
Review:  
The paper presents topological mapping  by learning muldimodal distributions using KDE. 
Comments to Author:
I would recommend authors to state how the spatial ranges are obtained and what
is the run time performance of the system. In Figure 1, left - can you denote what the 
different size of circles represent?

technical soundness: 5/5
demo: 5/5
clarity of description: 5/5
Review:

Title: 2D/3D Object Categorization for Task Based Grasping (M. Madry, D. Song, D. Kragic)
technical soundness: 3/5
demo: ?
clarity of description: 4/5
Review: 
The paper presents multi-cue-based object categorization (or classification) for the purpose of transferring the grasping knowledge.  
Comments to Author:
Why did you select the proposed selection of features over any other features? Could you also please comment 
how is the categorization of objects exactly performed (rule based, through classifier?).

Title: The Articulated Scene Model: Model-less Priors for Robot Object Learning (A. Swadzba, N. Beuter, S. Wachsmuth, F. Kummert)
technical soundness: 4/5
demo: 5/5
clarity of description: 3/5
Review: 
The paper presents scene modeling through BG/FG subtraction.  
Comments to Author:
Why is Entity != Object? How is your approach different from a simple segmentation of point cloud differences? 
How can the articulation model of e.g. drawer be generated? Also, I found referred videos to lack some annotations.

Title: A test bench to improve registration using RGB-D sensors (F. Pomerleau, S. Magnenat, F. Colas, M. Liu, R. Siegwart)
technical soundness: 5/5
demo: ?
clarity of description: 4/5
Review: 
The paper provides 2 main contributions: real-time tracker of the pose for RGBD sensors and Kinect dataset associated with the ground truth from Vicon. 
Comments to Author:
Looking at the wiki page for cloud_matcher I found a statement that "allowing a complete configuration of the registration chain through 
parameters leads to the a real-time tracker". Could you please clarify this? With respect to the dataset, it would help if you provided 
videos/images for a quick preview.

Title: Autonomous Corridor Flight of a UAV Using an RGB-D Camera (S. Lange, N. Suenderhauf, P. Neubert, S. Drews, P. Protzel)
technical soundness: 4/5
demo: ?
clarity of description: 3/5
Review: 
The paper presents a corridor flight of a UAV using segmented data from RGBD. 
Comments to Author:
RGB component does not seem to be used. An impressive overall system, but what is there new in terms of RGBD data processing
that goes beyond algorithms implemented in PCL? How does the specialized downsampling algorithm work? CUDA?
It also seem that flying in non-corridor like rooms would not be possible with the current approach

Title: RGB-D object recognition and localization with clutter and occlusions (F. Tombari, S. Salti, L. Di Stefano)
technical soundness: 5/5
demo: ?
clarity of description: 4/5
Review: 
The paper presents Object Recognition and Localization Pipeline using CSHOT - a feature that captures depth and RGB information.
Comments to Author:
On runtime 10 seconds - for how many objects, how many points/per object?
Could you also please comment about how sensitive is the approach to lighting changes?

Title: Acting and Interacting in the Real World (J. Bohg, N. Bergstrom, M. Bjorkman, D. Kragic)
technical soundness: 5/5
demo: ?
clarity of description: 4/5
Review: 
The paper presents object segmentation and reconstruction in the presence of clutter using symetry prior and plausibility rank.
Comments to Author:
On "robot now might want to know whether it has seen object before" - how do you memmorize the object's appearance?

Title: Efficient surface and feature estimation in RGBD (Z.-C. Marton, D. Pangercic, M. Beetz)
technical soundness: 5/5
demo: 5/5
clarity of description: 3/5
Review: The paper presents following 3 points: a) smoothing of noisy data with MLS, b) RSD and GRSD features and, finally, c) feature that captures 
2D as well as 3D properties of objects.

Title: Outdoor terrain traversability analysis for robot navigation using a time-of-flight camera (G. De Cubber, D. Doroftei, H. Sahli, Y. Baudoin)
technical soundness: 3/5
demo: ?
clarity of description: 3/5
Review:  
The paper presents an outdoor traversibility analysis using TOF camera. 
Comments to Author:
I have hard to believe that PMDTec would deliver any useful information outdoors. 
How does the terrain classification function exactly look like?
What does it depend on? Also it is not clear how exactly the RGB and the depth information is combined.

Title: 2.5D Local Feature Matching System
technical soundness: 4/5
demo: ?
clarity of description: 3/5
Review:
The paper compares local features (SIFT, SIFT with an affine pose corrected sample patch and SIFT with a projective corrected sample patch)
in the application of object matching under successive rotations.
Comments to Author:
Since both proposed fetures get outperformed by standard SIFT - what is the take home messages of the paper? 
I would also suggest peeking into the SIFT implementation for range images in Point Cloud Library.

Title: Interaction between pointclouds and camera images for human motion capture (K. Buys
technical soundness: 2/5
demo: 0
clarity of description: 2/5
Review:  
The paper aims at presenting i) the capture of human motions using RGBD images and ii) detection
of objects and persons in Robocup@home contest.
Comments to Author: The paper lacks details and results coming from the proposed algorithms. 
Furthermore, it introduces never expanded acryonyms (e.g. PF). It would also help
if you explain what is the application the pose estimation of a sleeping person is
used for and what how concretely do you plan to tackle problems in the Robocup@home contest.

Title: 3D object localization using superquadric models with a Kinect sensor (N. Biasi, I. Afanasyev, A. Fornaser, L. Baglivo, M. De Cecco)
technical soundness: 2/5
demo: 0
clarity of description: 2/5
Review:  
The paper presents object recognition(?) and localization using superquadric models.
Comments to Author:
While the approach is definitely technically sound it has on the other hand been vastly exploited in the area
of object detection and segmentation (e.g.: Efﬁcient 3D Object Detection by Fitting Superquadrics to Range Image
Data for Robot’s Object Manipulation, Georg Biegelbauer and Markus Vincze). Also, paper lacks evidences 
of method's working in form of e.g. figures and/or videos.

clarity of description: 3/5
Review:  
The paper presents a 3D perception pipeline for the purpose of unloading of containers - a method that author use in order to evaluate the model quality.
Comments to Author:
Could you please provide captions for the Figure, especually the bottom two images? Which TOF-cameras did you evaluate in particular?
