Title:
RGB-D Workshop on 3D Perception in Robotics

Venue:
Västerås, Sweden

Abstract:
In the past year, novel camera systems like Microsoft's Kinect that provide both color and dense depth images became readily available. There are great expectations that such systems will lead to a boost of new applications in the field of 3D perception which particularly relevant for robots operating in unstructured environments and under real-world conditions. Research fields that are expected to benefit from RGB-D-based perception include 3D mapping and localization, path planning, navigation, object recognition, people tracking, activity recognition, and human-robot interaction. 

The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers from robotics and computer vision to present and discuss current approaches on 3D perception using RGB-D sensors in robotics. The key outcomes of the workshop will be to establish an overview over a) the currently available sensor hardware, b) the state-of-the-art in 3D perception, c) the possible applications in industry,  and d) stimulate a discussion of the key challenges and opportunities of RGB-D-based perception in robotics.

Topics:
We solicit one-page A4 paper abstract submissions, optionally accompanied by a video both of which 
will be reviewed by the program committee. Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):
- sensor technology, calibration and data pre-processing,
- RGB-D interest points and feature descriptors,
- SLAM and semantic mapping,
- object recognition and localization,
- people tracking and activity recognition, 
- navigation,
- industrial applications.
We would especially like to encourage live demos either during the talks or in a special demo session
and plan to foster the discussion between the participants in a plenary discussion.

Schedule (4 hours):
- 6-8 presentations (20 min/presentation)
- coffee break (15 min)
- two invited talks (30 min)
- live demos (30 min)
- plenum discussion (30 min)
