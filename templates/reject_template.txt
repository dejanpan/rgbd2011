RGB-D Workshop on 3D Perception in Robotics

Dear authors,

Unfortunately, we have to inform you that your submission to the
Eurobotics Forum: RGB-D workshop on 3D perception in robotics has been
rejected based on the reviewers' comments.

Due to the large number of submissions and the half-day nature of the
workshop we were unfortunately unable to accommodate all submissions.

We will fix the final program of the workshop in the next few days
and update the website accordingly. We are looking forward to seeing
you in Vasteras on April 8th.

Best regards,
The Organizers
