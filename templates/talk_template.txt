RGB-D Workshop on 3D Perception in Robotics

Dear Authors,

It is our pleasure to inform you that your submission has been
accepted for publication and oral presentation at the Eurobotics Forum:
RGB-D workshop on 3D perception in robotics. Congratulations!

Due to the large number of submissions and the half-day nature of the
workshop, we decided to split the presentations into six talks and a
combined poster and demo session. We will fix the final program of the
workshop in the next few days and update the website accordingly.

Please revise your paper according to the reviewer comments below for
inclusion in the online workshop proceedings. The deadline for
submitting the camera ready version is March 27th.

If you have planned to give a live demonstration of your approach,
please let us know what your requirements are (e.g., space, tables,
power chords..).

We are planning to go out for dinner after the workshop. If you are
interested to join, please confirm your participation so that we can
reserve for the appropriate number of persons at the restaurant.


Best regards,
The Organizers
